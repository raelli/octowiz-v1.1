/**
 * A2A response normalization.
 *
 * Canonical contract: JS consumers (agent card, queue consumers, manage_agents
 * callers) speak camelCase. Python A2A capabilities speak snake_case. This
 * module is the single place that bridges the two — Python values are never
 * expected to arrive camelCased, and JS consumers never need to know about the
 * snake_case originals (though we preserve them so callers that already adapted
 * to snake_case stay unbroken).
 *
 * Alias map (Python snake_case → JS camelCase):
 *   session_id   → sessionId
 *   run_id       → runId
 *   exit_status  → exitStatus
 *
 * Rules:
 *   - Each alias is additive: the original key is kept so legacy callers work.
 *   - Aliasing only happens when the camelCase key is NOT already present; an
 *     existing camelCase value is never clobbered.
 *   - A null/undefined input is returned as an empty object — callers own the
 *     fallback for required fields (e.g. `{ status: "completed" }`).
